      project:
        author: specify the official author/project of this project, in case you are uploading a project produced by someone else
        license: \'CC-BY\' is the default license condition that PubAnnotation recommends, but of course you can specify any other if you want.
        reference: While PubAnnotation provides storage of annotation, it is desired to have a separate homepage of the annotation set that provides a comprehensive description of it.
        editor: Specify URL of the annotation editor you want to work with for your annotation project. If you have one that is not supported by PubAnnotation, please contact us.
