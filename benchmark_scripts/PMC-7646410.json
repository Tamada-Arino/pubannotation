COVID-19 has been reported in most countries, and as of August 15, 2020, there have been over 21 million cases of COVID-19 reported worldwide, with over 800 000 COVID-19-associated deaths. Although COVID-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system, it has become apparent that many other organ systems can also be involved. Imaging plays an essential role in the diagnosis of all manifestations of the disease and its related complications, and proper utilization and interpretation of imaging examinations is crucial. A comprehensive understanding of the diagnostic imaging hallmarks, imaging features, multisystem involvement, and evolution of imaging findings is essential for effective patient management and treatment. In part 1 of this article, the authors described the viral pathogenesis, diagnostic imaging hallmarks, and manifestations of the pulmonary and peripheral and central vascular systems of COVID-19. In part 2 of this article, the authors focus on the key imaging features of the varied pathologic manifestations of COVID-19, involving the cardiac, neurologic, abdominal, dermatologic and ocular, and musculoskeletal systems, as well as the pediatric and pregnancy-related manifestations of the virus.","denotations":[{"id":"15","span":{"begin":15,"end":62},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"16","span":{"begin":897,"end":904},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"17","span":{"begin":0,"end":9},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"18","span":{"begin":74,"end":98},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"19","span":{"begin":100,"end":108},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"20","span":{"begin":203,"end":211},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"21","span":{"begin":317,"end":325},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"22","span":{"begin":364,"end":372},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"23","span":{"begin":384,"end":390},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"24","span":{"begin":401,"end":409},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"25","span":{"begin":1117,"end":1125},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"26","span":{"begin":1243,"end":1251},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"27","span":{"begin":1328,"end":1351},"obj":"Disease"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A15","subj":"15","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:2697049"},{"id":"A16","subj":"16","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A17","subj":"17","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D007239"},{"id":"A18","subj":"18","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A19","subj":"19","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A20","subj":"20","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A21","subj":"21","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A22","subj":"22","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A23","subj":"23","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D003643"},{"id":"A24","subj":"24","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A25","subj":"25","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A26","subj":"26","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A27","subj":"27","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D009140"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"  Describe the body system-specific pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2.","denotations":[{"id":"29","span":{"begin":55,"end":65},"obj":"Species"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A29","subj":"29","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:2697049"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"  Discuss the most appropriate imaging modalities and radiologic recommendations for the diagnosis of nonpulmonary multisystem manifestations of COVID-19.","denotations":[{"id":"31","span":{"begin":145,"end":153},"obj":"Disease"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A31","subj":"31","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"  Recognize key imaging features of nonpulmonary multisystem manifestations of COVID-19, as well as its manifestations in pediatric and pregnant patients.","denotations":[{"id":"34","span":{"begin":145,"end":153},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"35","span":{"begin":79,"end":87},"obj":"Disease"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A34","subj":"34","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A35","subj":"35","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"After completing this journal-based SA-CME activity, participants will be able to:","denotations":[{"id":"37","span":{"begin":53,"end":65},"obj":"Species"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A37","subj":"37","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every country in the world, and by August 2020 COVID-19 had infected over 21 million people.

These include myocardial dysfunction and arrhythmia, acute coronary syndromes, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatocellular injury, hyperglycemia and ketosis, neurologic illnesses, ocular symptoms, and dermatologic complications . Such widespread involvement of multiple body systems is attributable to the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors (an entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) in multiple extrapulmonary tissues, resulting in direct viral tissue damage.

Nonischemic myocardial injury can occur in the setting of myocarditis and stress-induced cardiomyopathy, with occurrence of acute heart failure in those without a history of ventricular dysfunction.","denotations":[{"id":"213","span":{"begin":456,"end":464},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"214","span":{"begin":338,"end":344},"obj":"Chemical"},{"id":"215","span":{"begin":46,"end":63},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"216","span":{"begin":92,"end":107},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"217","span":{"begin":133,"end":147},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"218","span":{"begin":152,"end":171},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"219","span":{"begin":186,"end":207},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"220","span":{"begin":216,"end":225},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"221","span":{"begin":241,"end":250},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"222","span":{"begin":308,"end":314},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"223","span":{"begin":421,"end":440},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"224","span":{"begin":481,"end":504},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"225","span":{"begin":517,"end":555},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"226","span":{"begin":588,"end":594},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"227","span":{"begin":615,"end":625},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"228","span":{"begin":715,"end":723},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"229","span":{"begin":731,"end":750},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"230","span":{"begin":763,"end":782},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"231","span":{"begin":796,"end":813},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"232","span":{"begin":842,"end":853},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"233","span":{"begin":873,"end":887},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"234","span":{"begin":908,"end":927},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"235","span":{"begin":958,"end":981},"obj":"Disease"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A213","subj":"213","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A214","subj":"214","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D010100"},{"id":"A215","subj":"215","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D009202"},{"id":"A216","subj":"216","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D001102"},{"id":"A217","subj":"217","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D012421"},{"id":"A218","subj":"218","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D003328"},{"id":"A219","subj":"219","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D009203"},{"id":"A220","subj":"220","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D007239"},{"id":"A221","subj":"221","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D000860"},{"id":"A222","subj":"222","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D018805"},{"id":"A223","subj":"223","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D003324"},{"id":"A224","subj":"224","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D050197"},{"id":"A225","subj":"225","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D004211"},{"id":"A226","subj":"226","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D018805"},{"id":"A227","subj":"227","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D013927"},{"id":"A228","subj":"228","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D007511"},{"id":"A229","subj":"229","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D009202"},{"id":"A230","subj":"230","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D006331"},{"id":"A231","subj":"231","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D009202"},{"id":"A232","subj":"232","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D009205"},{"id":"A233","subj":"233","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D009202"},{"id":"A234","subj":"234","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D006333"},{"id":"A235","subj":"235","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D018754"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"Imaging plays an important role in early diagnosis of disease in patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions, as well as detection of cardiovascular complications in those with an established SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Emerging evidence of the high prevalence of cardiac involvement in patients with COVID-19 justifies the need for performing MRI in this patient population. In fact, in a recent cohort study of 100 patients who recovered from COVID-19, cardiac MRI helped confirm cardiac involvement in 78 patients (78%) and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%). These findings were independent of preexisting conditions, the severity and overall course of acute illness, and the time from the original diagnosis. However, cardiac MRI may be deferred in patients with elevated troponin levels or suspected myocardial injury related to myocarditis, owing to risk-benefit concerns related to infection control measures.

Other neurologic manifestations include epilepsy, disturbed consciousness, encephalopathy, and headache. Various pathophysiologic mechanisms of neurologic sequelae have been proposed, including injury to the vascular endothelial and epithelial cells, resulting in disruption of the blood brain barrier; hypoxic injury owing to respiratory failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) and prolonged ventilation; ACE2 receptor-facilitated entry of the virus into neural tissue cells; and immune injury secondary to cytokine storm syndrome. In fact, the neurotropism of coronavirus may indeed be responsible for the relatively high percentage of neurologic involvement in this group. In addition, SARS-CoV-2-induced coagulopathy significantly contributes to the development of neurologic manifestations in patients with COVID-19.","denotations":[{"id":"779","span":{"begin":564,"end":568},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"780","span":{"begin":720,"end":731},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"781","span":{"begin":847,"end":857},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"782","span":{"begin":956,"end":964},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"783","span":{"begin":74,"end":82},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"784","span":{"begin":94,"end":106},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"785","span":{"begin":185,"end":193},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"786","span":{"begin":220,"end":234},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"787","span":{"begin":240,"end":248},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"788","span":{"begin":448,"end":491},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"789","span":{"begin":493,"end":528},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"790","span":{"begin":530,"end":534},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"791","span":{"begin":639,"end":652},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"792","span":{"begin":866,"end":878},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"793","span":{"begin":970,"end":978},"obj":"Disease"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A779","subj":"779","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Gene:59272"},{"id":"A780","subj":"780","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:11118"},{"id":"A781","subj":"781","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:2697049"},{"id":"A782","subj":"782","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A783","subj":"783","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A784","subj":"784","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D020521"},{"id":"A785","subj":"785","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D004827"},{"id":"A786","subj":"786","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D001927"},{"id":"A787","subj":"787","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D006261"},{"id":"A788","subj":"788","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D012131"},{"id":"A789","subj":"789","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D012128"},{"id":"A790","subj":"790","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D012128"},{"id":"A791","subj":"791","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D007154"},{"id":"A792","subj":"792","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D001778"},{"id":"A793","subj":"793","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"Patients with COVID-19 who present with neurologic or psychiatric symptoms may undergo nonenhanced CT of the head to identify potential vascular complications such as stroke, hemorrhage, or venous sinus thrombosis.

SARS-CoV-2 tropism to the gastrointestinal tract is likely due to its abundant expression of ACE2 receptors, specifically in the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, small and large intestine (including the rectum), and biliary endothelium.","denotations":[{"id":"1659","span":{"begin":626,"end":630},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"1660","span":{"begin":9,"end":17},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"1661","span":{"begin":75,"end":83},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"1662","span":{"begin":205,"end":213},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"1663","span":{"begin":292,"end":303},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"1664","span":{"begin":351,"end":359},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"1665","span":{"begin":533,"end":543},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"1666","span":{"begin":41,"end":60},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"1667","span":{"begin":89,"end":97},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"1668","span":{"begin":145,"end":153},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"1669","span":{"begin":155,"end":163},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"1670","span":{"begin":175,"end":189},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"1671","span":{"begin":219,"end":227},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"1672","span":{"begin":272,"end":286},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"1673","span":{"begin":365,"end":385},"obj":"Disease"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A1659","subj":"1659","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Gene:59272"},{"id":"A1660","subj":"1660","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A1661","subj":"1661","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A1662","subj":"1662","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A1663","subj":"1663","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:11118"},{"id":"A1664","subj":"1664","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A1665","subj":"1665","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:2697049"},{"id":"A1666","subj":"1666","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D012140"},{"id":"A1667","subj":"1667","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A1668","subj":"1668","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D003967"},{"id":"A1669","subj":"1669","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D014839"},{"id":"A1670","subj":"1670","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D015746"},{"id":"A1671","subj":"1671","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A1672","subj":"1672","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D002779"},{"id":"A1673","subj":"1673","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"US has served as a primary imaging modality for patients with abdominal and pelvic symptoms during this pandemic.

Associated thrombosis of one of the splenic hilar branches supplying the anterior upper pole of the spleen is noted (dashed arrow in a). In addition, there is marked irregular wall thickening of the contrast material-filled urinary bladder (B and black arrows in a and b). It is important to note that patients with underlying conditions (such as hypercoagulable state in the setting of malignancy) are prone to develop complications of COVID-19. (c) Axial diffusion-weighted image (DWI) of the brain obtained during a hospital stay for newly developed neurological deficits shows a confluent region of restricted diffusion (arrows) within territory supplied by the left middle cerebral artery, indicative of an acute infarct.

When disease is severe, features of myonecrosis may also be present, with heterogeneous muscle parenchyma with rim enhancement and possible areas of necrosis visualized as T2-hyperintense areas when compared with the adjacent intact muscle signal intensity.

Over three-fourths of patients (75.6%) had a history of exposure to a family member who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 or had been residing in an area with a high population of cases, both of which serve as the most common vectors for childhood infection.","denotations":[{"id":"3688","span":{"begin":196,"end":204},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3689","span":{"begin":320,"end":328},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3690","span":{"begin":381,"end":389},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3691","span":{"begin":488,"end":496},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3692","span":{"begin":98,"end":106},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"3693","span":{"begin":107,"end":113},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"3694","span":{"begin":239,"end":254},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"3695","span":{"begin":334,"end":342},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"3696","span":{"begin":578,"end":586},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"3697","span":{"begin":713,"end":722},"obj":"Disease"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A3688","subj":"3688","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3689","subj":"3689","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3690","subj":"3690","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3691","subj":"3691","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3692","subj":"3692","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A3693","subj":"3693","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D003643"},{"id":"A3694","subj":"3694","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D006331"},{"id":"A3695","subj":"3695","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A3696","subj":"3696","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A3697","subj":"3697","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D007239"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"Although chest radiography is frequently the first imaging study performed in a pediatric patient presenting with fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath, current literature describing COVID-19 findings on chest radiographs in children is relatively scarce. In a systematic review article published in Lancet, Hoang et al reported that most patients had normal chest radiographs. At CT, diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities were the most common finding at all stages of disease, and a peripheral distribution of pulmonary opacities was observed, similar to in adult patients. However, it is interesting to note that consolidations with a surrounding halo sign were more commonly visualized in children than adults, and that no associated lymphadenopathy or pleural effusions were observed. According to the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria, imaging is not indicated in a well-appearing immunocompetent child older than 3 months of age who does not require hospitalization. However, if the child is not responding to outpatient management or requires hospitalization, chest radiography is considered the most appropriate first step in imaging evaluation. Similar to the adult population, the Radiological Society of North America consensus statement on pediatric patients with respect to use of CT states that chest CT should be reserved for symptomatic hospitalized patients with specific clinical indications. Given its relative safety and repeatability, lung US is another imaging modality that has been widely used in pediatric patients with COVID-19, with similar findings in the lungs with those in the adult population.","denotations":[{"id":"3716","span":{"begin":90,"end":97},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3717","span":{"begin":228,"end":236},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3718","span":{"begin":342,"end":350},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3719","span":{"begin":571,"end":579},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3720","span":{"begin":698,"end":706},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3721","span":{"begin":929,"end":934},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3722","span":{"begin":1016,"end":1021},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3723","span":{"begin":1043,"end":1053},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3724","span":{"begin":1289,"end":1297},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3725","span":{"begin":1393,"end":1401},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3726","span":{"begin":1558,"end":1566},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"3727","span":{"begin":114,"end":119},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"3728","span":{"begin":121,"end":126},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"3729","span":{"begin":135,"end":154},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"3730","span":{"begin":186,"end":194},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"3731","span":{"begin":743,"end":758},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"3732","span":{"begin":762,"end":779},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"3733","span":{"begin":1572,"end":1580},"obj":"Disease"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A3716","subj":"3716","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3717","subj":"3717","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3718","subj":"3718","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3719","subj":"3719","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3720","subj":"3720","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3721","subj":"3721","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3722","subj":"3722","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3723","subj":"3723","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3724","subj":"3724","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3725","subj":"3725","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3726","subj":"3726","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A3727","subj":"3727","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D005334"},{"id":"A3728","subj":"3728","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D003371"},{"id":"A3729","subj":"3729","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D004417"},{"id":"A3730","subj":"3730","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A3731","subj":"3731","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D008206"},{"id":"A3732","subj":"3732","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D010996"},{"id":"A3733","subj":"3733","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"There are limited data regarding the neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 in children.

In general, US is the preferred modality for the evaluation of a pregnant patient and the fetus, as it can be used for evaluation and surveillance of the maternal lungs, assessment of potential maternal abdominal and vascular complications, and evaluation of fetal well-being, as well as the gravid uterus.","denotations":[{"id":"4228","span":{"begin":9,"end":17},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"4229","span":{"begin":489,"end":497},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"4230","span":{"begin":594,"end":602},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"4231","span":{"begin":881,"end":888},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"4232","span":{"begin":793,"end":805},"obj":"Chemical"},{"id":"4233","span":{"begin":23,"end":31},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"4234","span":{"begin":55,"end":75},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"4235","span":{"begin":144,"end":161},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"4236","span":{"begin":310,"end":325},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"4237","span":{"begin":330,"end":347},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"4238","span":{"begin":369,"end":373},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"4239","span":{"begin":513,"end":531},"obj":"Disease"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A4228","subj":"4228","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A4229","subj":"4229","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A4230","subj":"4230","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A4231","subj":"4231","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A4233","subj":"4233","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A4234","subj":"4234","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D012818"},{"id":"A4235","subj":"4235","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D008171"},{"id":"A4236","subj":"4236","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D008206"},{"id":"A4237","subj":"4237","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D010996"},{"id":"A4238","subj":"4238","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D012128"},{"id":"A4239","subj":"4239","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D011655"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has rapidly resulted in a worldwide pandemic and has been the cause of extreme morbidity and mortality. It primarily affects the respiratory system but has also been shown to impact other systems in the human body, resulting in multiorgan injury and, in some cases, failure. Imaging plays a significant role in the detection, diagnosis, and assessment of virus-induced injury and associated complications. Recognizing and understanding the pathophysiology of the virus and its effects on the immune system and coagulation is paramount toward improving radiologists' ability to accurately identify key imaging findings and promptly recognize possible complications, thus minimizing the number of diagnostic misinterpretations. Owing to the complexity of viral pathophysiology and its targeting of multiple organ systems, the recognition of one complication should prompt intense scrutiny for others, particularly if patients are critically ill. A thorough knowledge of diagnostic imaging hallmarks, atypical imaging features, multisystem manifestations, and evolution of imaging findings is essential to optimize patient care.","denotations":[{"id":"4248","span":{"begin":0,"end":10},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"4249","span":{"begin":16,"end":33},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"4250","span":{"begin":242,"end":247},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"4251","span":{"begin":954,"end":962},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"4252","span":{"begin":1151,"end":1158},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"4253","span":{"begin":132,"end":141},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"4254","span":{"begin":267,"end":284},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"4255","span":{"begin":967,"end":981},"obj":"Disease"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A4248","subj":"4248","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:2697049"},{"id":"A4249","subj":"4249","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:2697049"},{"id":"A4250","subj":"4250","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A4251","subj":"4251","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A4252","subj":"4252","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A4253","subj":"4253","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D003643"},{"id":"A4254","subj":"4254","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D014947"},{"id":"A4255","subj":"4255","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D016638"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"angiotensin-converting enzyme 2","denotations":[{"id":"4257","span":{"begin":0,"end":29},"obj":"Gene"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A4257","subj":"4257","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Gene:1636"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"ADC","denotations":[{"id":"4259","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Chemical"}],"attributes":[]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"COVID-19","denotations":[{"id":"4261","span":{"begin":0,"end":8},"obj":"Disease"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A4261","subj":"4261","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"coronavirus disease 2019","denotations":[{"id":"4263","span":{"begin":0,"end":24},"obj":"Disease"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A4263","subj":"4263","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"}]},{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome","denotations":[{"id":"4265","span":{"begin":10,"end":43},"obj":"Disease"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A4265","subj":"4265","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D056587"}]}]
