    For small projects, SQLite can be used instead of ProgreSQL without all the hassle
    of DBMS installation and management."

  title: Conversion of text encoding
  body: "All the documents in PubAnnotation are stored in UTF-8 which is the default
    encoding of PubMed and PMC.

    Annotations to the documents are also stored along to the UTF-8 texts.

    The documents are however also accessible in ASCII encoding: for example, a Greek
    letter, Î±, is spelled out to, alpha.

    In the case, the annotations to the documents are also aligned to the ASCII texts
    accordingly."

  title: Annotation in various formats
  body: "Annotations stored in PubAnnotation can be accessed in various formats.\r\nFor
    any annotation, default formats are table (CSV) and JSON.\r\n<ul><li><strong>table</strong>(CSV)
    format is easy to read and for handling using for example Excel.</li><li><strong>JSON</strong>
    or JavaScript Object Notation format is more machine-friendly. It is quite standard
    now, and users can just use a publicly available JSON reader which can be found
    for most of major programming languages.</li></ul>\r\nAdditionally, conversion
    to various other formats can be easily implemented using PubAnnotaion's plug-in
    system.\r\nExamples include followings:\r\n<ul><li><strong>RDF</strong> or Resource
    Description Framework format is standard in Semantic Web technology. SPARQL query
    language can be applied to search for annotations in specific patterns, e.g.,
    to search for all the pair of event trigger and protein annotations in the same
    sentence.<li><strong>XML</strong></li><li>and so on.</li></ul>\r\n"
