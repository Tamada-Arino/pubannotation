{"sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"7646410","text":"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 results in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was declared an official pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has been reported in most countries, and as of August 15, 2020, there have been over 21 million cases of COVID-19 reported worldwide, with over 800 000 COVID-19-associated deaths. Although COVID-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system, it has become apparent that many other organ systems can also be involved. Imaging plays an essential role in the diagnosis of all manifestations of the disease and its related complications, and proper utilization and interpretation of imaging examinations is crucial. A comprehensive understanding of the diagnostic imaging hallmarks, imaging features, multisystem involvement, and evolution of imaging findings is essential for effective patient management and treatment. In part 1 of this article, the authors described the viral pathogenesis, diagnostic imaging hallmarks, and manifestations of the pulmonary and peripheral and central vascular systems of COVID-19. In part 2 of this article, the authors focus on the key imaging features of the varied pathologic manifestations of COVID-19, involving the cardiac, neurologic, abdominal, dermatologic and ocular, and musculoskeletal systems, as well as the pediatric and pregnancy-related manifestations of the virus.","denotations":[{"id":"15","span":{"begin":15,"end":62},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"16","span":{"begin":897,"end":904},"obj":"Species"},{"id":"17","span":{"begin":0,"end":9},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"18","span":{"begin":74,"end":98},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"19","span":{"begin":100,"end":108},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"20","span":{"begin":203,"end":211},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"21","span":{"begin":317,"end":325},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"22","span":{"begin":364,"end":372},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"23","span":{"begin":384,"end":390},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"24","span":{"begin":401,"end":409},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"25","span":{"begin":1117,"end":1125},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"26","span":{"begin":1243,"end":1251},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"27","span":{"begin":1328,"end":1351},"obj":"Disease"}],"attributes":[{"id":"A15","subj":"15","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:2697049"},{"id":"A16","subj":"16","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"Tax:9606"},{"id":"A17","subj":"17","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D007239"},{"id":"A18","subj":"18","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A19","subj":"19","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A20","subj":"20","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A21","subj":"21","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A22","subj":"22","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A23","subj":"23","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D003643"},{"id":"A24","subj":"24","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A25","subj":"25","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A26","subj":"26","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:C000657245"},{"id":"A27","subj":"27","pred":"pubann:denotes","obj":"MESH:D009140"}]}
