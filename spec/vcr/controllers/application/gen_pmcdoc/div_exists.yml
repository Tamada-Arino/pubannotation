        cellular and molecular mechanisms that control acute inflammation and its
        resolution are of wide interest. Using self-resolving inflammatory exudates
        and lipidomics, we have identified a new pathway involving biosynthesis of
        potent antiinflammatory and proresolving mediators from the essential fatty
        acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) by macrophages (M&#x3A6;s). During the resolution
        of mouse peritonitis, exudates accumulated both 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic
        acid, a known marker of 17<italic>S</italic>-D series resolvin (Rv) and protectin
        biosynthesis, and 14<italic>S</italic>-hydroxydocosa-4<italic>Z</italic>,7<italic>Z</italic>,10<italic>Z</italic>,12<italic>E</italic>,16<italic>Z</italic>,19<italic>Z</italic>-hexaenoic
        acid from endogenous DHA. Addition of either DHA or 14<italic>S</italic>-hydroperoxydocosa-4<italic>Z</italic>,7<italic>Z</italic>,10<italic>Z</italic>,12<italic>E</italic>,16<italic>Z</italic>,19<italic>Z</italic>-hexaenoic
        acid to activated M&#x3A6;s converted these substrates to novel dihydroxy-containing
        products that possessed potent antiinflammatory and proresolving activity
        with a potency similar to resolvin E1, 5<italic>S</italic>,12<italic>R</italic>,18<italic>R</italic>-trihydroxyeicosa-6<italic>Z</italic>,8<italic>E</italic>,10<italic>E</italic>,14<italic>Z</italic>,16<italic>E</italic>-pentaenoic
        acid, and protectin D1, 10<italic>R</italic>,17<italic>S</italic>-dihydroxydocosa-4<italic>Z</italic>,7<italic>Z</italic>,11<italic>E</italic>,13<italic>E</italic>,15<italic>Z</italic>,19<italic>Z</italic>-hexaenoic
        acid. Stable isotope incorporation, intermediate trapping, and characterization
        of physical and biological properties of the products demonstrated a novel
        14-lipoxygenase pathway, generating bioactive 7,14-dihydroxydocosa-4<italic>Z</italic>,8,10,12,16<italic>Z</italic>,19<italic>Z</italic>-hexaenoic
        acid, coined M&#x3A6; mediator in resolving inflammation (maresin), which
        enhances resolution. These findings suggest that maresins and this new metabolome
        may be involved in some of the beneficial actions of DHA and M&#x3A6;s in
        tissue homeostasis, inflammation resolution, wound healing, and host defense.</p>\n
        \     </abstract>\n    </article-meta>\n  </front>\n  <body><p>Given the contribution
        of uncontrolled inflammation to many human diseases, the identification of
        endogenous control mechanisms in the acute inflammatory response is of wide
        interest (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib1\">1</xref>). Classical lipid
        mediators such as the prostaglandins and leukotrienes are well appreciated
        for their important proinflammatory roles in inflammation (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"bib2\">2</xref>). In recent years, the resolution of inflammation has
        emerged as an area with considerable potential to contain local mediators
        that may be useful for new therapeutic approaches (for reviews see references
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib3\">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">4</xref>).
        Using an unbiased systems approach using lipidomics, proteomics, and cell
        trafficking to study self-resolving inflammatory exudates revealed that the
        termination of acute inflammation involves active biosynthetic processes producing
        novel endogenous lipid mediators that are both antiinflammatory and proresolving
        (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib5\">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"bib8\">8</xref>). It is now clear that resolution of acute inflammation
        is an active rather than passive process, as previously understood (<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib9\">9</xref>), generating novel potent counterregulatory
        mediators termed resolvins (Rvs) and protectins (for review see reference
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">4</xref>).</p><p>Rvs and protectins are
        biosynthesized by exudates from essential omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., eicosapentaenoic
        acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]), and the structures are established
        for key members of these families (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">4</xref>).
        The immune regulatory actions of omega-3 fatty acids and their roles in human
        health and diseases such as cancer and neuroinflammation are widely appreciated
        (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib10\">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"bib12\">12</xref>). Although omega-3 fatty acids are in wide use as
        dietary supplements and potential therapeutics in many diseases, including
        inflammatory diseases, their mechanisms and connection to inflammation remain
        of interest. Rvs and protectins display potent multilevel antiinflammatory
        and proresolving actions (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib13\">13</xref>)
        and are members of a new genus of endogenous mediators of resolution (<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">4</xref>). For example, resolvin E1, 5<italic>S</italic>,12<italic>R</italic>,18<italic>R</italic>-trihydroxyeicosa-6<italic>Z</italic>,8<italic>E</italic>,10<italic>E</italic>,14<italic>Z</italic>,16<italic>E</italic>-pentaenoic
        acid (RvE1) is biosynthesized from EPA and interacts with specific receptors
        to control inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib14\">14</xref>,
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib15\">15</xref>). Also, <italic>fat-1</italic>
        transgenic mice, producing higher endogenous levels of omega-3, show reduced
        inflammatory status and elevated levels of Rvs and protectins, which when
        administered reduce inflammation and stimulate resolution (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"bib16\">16</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib18\">18</xref>).
        The main biosynthetic route with DHA for Rvs and protectins proceeds during
        resolution via a 17<italic>S</italic>-hydroperoxydocosahexaenoic intermediate
        produced by a lipoxygenase (LOX) mechanism. With aspirin therapy, acetylated
        cyclooxygenase-2 produces aspirin-triggered 17<italic>R</italic>-epimers of
        Rvs and protectins and also enhances their formation (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"bib6\">6</xref>). Genetic deficiency or overexpression of mouse 12/15-LOX
        regulates production of Rvs and protectins, and alters their responses to
        both thermal injury and extent of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"bib17\">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib18\">18</xref>).</p><p>In
        this report, we present evidence for a new pathway of mediators operative
        in resolution of acute inflammation that possess potent actions with polymorphonuclear
        neutrophils (PMNs) and macrophages (M&#x3A6;s). Identification of these new
        mediators, coined M&#x3A6; mediators in resolving inflammation (maresins),
        provides evidence for autacoids produced from essential omega-3 fatty acids
        by a new pathway that may be linked to homeostasis, inflammation resolution,
        wound healing, and cancer.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Targeted
        lipidomics of resolving inflammatory exudates</title><p>In view of the actions
        of specialized chemical mediators in resolution (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib6\">6</xref>,
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib7\">7</xref>), we monitored 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic
        acid (17-HDHA) as a biomarker of activation and conversion of endogenous DHA,
        and also used targeted lipidomics to query whether other pathways were operative
        (<xref rid=\"fig1\" ref-type=\"fig\">Fig. 1</xref>). During this course of
        peritonitis, PMNs rapidly entered, reaching maximum within 12 h. As expected
        in this self-resolving system (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib19\">19</xref>),
        PMNs declined and were lost from exudates, thus defining resolution (<xref
        rid=\"fig1\" ref-type=\"fig\">Fig. 1</xref>). Unbiased targeted mediator lipidomics
        using liquid chromatography&#x2013;tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)&#x2013;based
        analyses were performed with these exudates. In addition to 17<italic>S</italic>-hydroxydocosa-4<italic>Z</italic>,7<italic>Z</italic>,10<italic>Z</italic>,13<italic>Z</italic>,15<italic>E</italic>,19<italic>Z</italic>-hexaenoic

        endogenous DHA was converted to 14<italic>S</italic>-hydroxydocosa-4<italic>Z</italic>,7<italic>Z</italic>,10<italic>Z</italic>,12<italic>E</italic>,16<italic>Z</italic>,19<italic>Z</italic>-hexaenoic
        acid (14<italic>S</italic>-HDHA). Neither product was identified in exudates
        obtained with the LOX inhibitor esculetin (<italic>n</italic> = 3), and both
        were substantially reduced in peritonitis lavages from 12/15-LOX&#x2013;deficient
        mice (<italic>n</italic> = 2, d = 4). The appearance of 14<italic>S</italic>-HDHA
        in this system accompanied 17-HDHA throughout the 72-h course, indicating
        that 14<italic>S</italic>-HDHA accumulated within the resolution phase.</p><fig

        325, 299, and 281 ions are shared between 14- and 17-HDHA (<xref rid=\"fig1\"
        ref-type=\"fig\">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>, insets). Both 14<italic>S</italic>-HDHA
        and 17-HDHA were also generated from endogenous DHA with isolated mouse M&#x3A6;s
        activated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore A<sub>23187</sub> (5 &#x3BC;M, pH

        325 pg/10<sup>6</sup> cells, and 17-HDHA, 439 pg/10<sup>6</sup> cells). These
        results demonstrate that during the time course of acute inflammation and
        its resolution, a sustained production of endogenous LOX products was present
        in the initial acute phase at 2&#x2013;4 h that accumulated during resolution
        with the highest levels of 14<italic>S</italic>-HDHA &gt; 17-HDHA at 72 h.</p><p>We
        reasoned that 14<italic>S</italic>-HDHA might be a marker reflecting activation
        of a novel DHA (C22:6) carbon 14&#x2013;lipoxygenation pathway. This could
        lead to production of bioactive mediators via DHA, because monohydroxy products
        of polyunsaturated fatty acids are biomarkers of pathways leading to potent
        bioactive molecules, as in the case of 17-HDHA and 17-HpDHA, precursors to
        Rvs and protectins (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib6\">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"bib20\">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib21\">21</xref>).
        Also, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid is a well-appreciated marker of arachidonic
        acid conversion to leukotrienes (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib2\">2</xref>).
        To this end, resident peritoneal M&#x3A6;s were isolated (<xref rid=\"fig2\"
        ref-type=\"fig\">Fig. 2 A</xref>, FACS inset), containing &#x223C;85&#x2013;90%

        acid (14<italic>S</italic>-HpDHA) was prepared via biogenic synthesis and
        incubated with these cells to determine whether it was a precursor to new

        with HPLC-purified DHA (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and was &gt;98% <italic>S</italic>

        followed by either reduction to 14<italic>S</italic>-HDHA and/or, via double
        dioxygenation (e.g., sequential 12-LOX&#x2013;5-LOX), to generate 7<italic>S</italic>,14<italic>S</italic>-diHDHA.
        In 12/15-LOX&#x2013;deficient mice, 14<italic>S</italic>-HDHA generation in

        to bioactive 7,14<italic>S</italic>-diHDHA by creating a conjugated triene
        within three of the six double bonds. The results from <sup>18</sup>O isotope

        is an essential fatty acid and member of the omega-3 family of fatty acids,
        which are in high levels in marine oils. It is essential for mammalian systems
        in that it is not biosynthesized de novo and is therefore a nutritional requirement

        In this report, we identified a novel pathway during resolution that converts
        DHA to new, potent bioactive products. This new pathway was identified using
        targeted mediator lipidomics of exudates from mouse peritonitis and was demonstrated
        with both mouse and human M&#x3A6;s. Parallel biofunction and spectral analyses
        confirmed the new structures as 7,14-dihydroxy&#x2013;containing products
        biosynthesized from DHA. One of the novel products characterized, MaR1, proved
        to be a potent mediator, stopping PMN infiltration and stimulating M&#x3A6;
        phagocytosis. An isomer of MaR1, 7<italic>S</italic>,14<italic>S</italic>-diHDHA,
        was less potent, indicating stereoselective actions in vitro and in vivo.
        These antiinflammatory and proresolving actions were evident in nanogram range
        both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this new mediator pathway could
        play a key role in regulating catabasis or the return of tissues from the
        inflammatory state to homeostasis (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib8\">8</xref>,
        <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib13\">13</xref>).</p><p>The new compounds
        isolated from M&#x3A6;s showed distinct and separate actions on PMNs compared
        with mononuclear cells, such as those recently identified for multifunctional
        mediators. Specifically, to expedite resolution, members of this new genus
        of endogenous mediators carry multilevel actions limiting further PMN accumulation
        at tissue sites and stimulate clearance by enhancing M&#x3A6; nonphlogistic
        phagocytosis (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"bib23\">23</xref>). This type of selectivity places a spatial and temporal
        as well as a functional separation between these new mediators from, e.g.,
        leukotrienes, which stimulate proinflammatory responses.</p><p>When compared
        with RvE1 derived from EPA and PD1/NPD1 from DHA that carries alcohol groups
        at carbons 10 and 17 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib6\">6</xref>, <xref

        potency (<xref rid=\"fig3\" ref-type=\"fig\">Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast,
        PGE<sub>2</sub> did not enhance phagocytosis, a finding consistent with PGE<sub>2</sub>
        and PGD<sub>2</sub> specifically reducing M&#x3A6; phagocytosis of apoptotic
        cells (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib24\">24</xref>). Although D and E
        series Rvs as well as PD1 share proresolving and antiinflammatory actions
        for the genus, each member acts at specific receptors (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"bib4\">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib14\">14</xref>) and,
        thus, given the stereospecific actions of the new pathway mediators, it is
        likely that they act on their own receptors separate from those for Rvs. These
        findings with novel chemical mediators suggest that enhancing M&#x3A6; capacity
        to remove apoptotic and necrotic cells at sites of inflammation and enhancing
        microbial particle containment along with down-regulating new PMN entry to
        the site may not only shorten the resolution interval (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"bib8\">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib13\">13</xref>) but
        can also protect tissues from unwanted tissue injury damage and oxidative
        stress that can accompany inflammation and infection.</p><p>We also found
        that the epoxide intermediate can undergo nonenzymatic hydrolysis to give
        7<italic>R/S</italic>,14<italic>S</italic>-dihydroxy&#x2013;containing products
        (which appear to coelute in this LC system) and corresponding vicinal diol,

        The proposed biosynthetic sequence is also supported by results from <sup>18</sup>O
        incorporation and deuterium (d<sub>5</sub>)-labeled tracking from d<sub>5</sub>-DHA
        to d<sub>5</sub>-labeled maresin pathway products. Collectively, these results
        provide evidence for a highly efficient pathway in isolated resident M&#x3A6;s
        for the biosynthesis of potent new chemical mediators via 14-lipoxygenation
        of DHA and subsequent enzymatic steps (<xref rid=\"fig5\" ref-type=\"fig\">Fig.

        other new products from DHA generated by M&#x3A6;s, a 13(14)-epoxy-alcohol&#x2013;containing

        Thus, although 14<italic>S</italic>-HDHA was identified in many systems, it
        remained to be determined that it can serve as a marker of DHA conversion
        to novel bioactive mediators. It should be noted that, in addition to 14<italic>S</italic>-HDHA
        production by cells with 12-LOX, human 15-LOX can also contribute to this
        14-LOX pathway because M&#x3A6;s and other human cells possess a prominent
        12-LOX and 15-LOX (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\"
        rid=\"bib10\">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib18\">18</xref>),
        and 14<italic>S</italic>-HDHA was essentially absent in 12/15-LOX&#x2013;deficient
        mice. Given the importance of platelet 12-LOX in transcellular biosynthesis
        of lipid mediators (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">4</xref>), it is
        likely that cell&#x2013;cell interactions can also contribute to biosynthesis
        of maresins and related products.</p><p>Although marine omega-3 fatty acid
        supplements are in wide use in animals and humans because they are believed
        to possess therapeutic actions, convincing evidence from clinical trials supporting
        their actions in treating inflammatory disorders and reducing cancer risk
        are not without criticism (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib29\">29</xref>&#x2013;<xref
        ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib31\">31</xref>). Possible sources of variation
        in their actions in clinical studies are (a) the very high doses used (milligram
        to gram doses), (b) the absence of appropriate biomarkers of omega-3 fatty
        acid utilization, and (c) specific mediator functions evoked in pico- to nanogram
        range. Thus, the new pathways and bioactive maresins documented in this report,
        along with Rvs, protectins, and related functional metabolome, might provide
        a new means to mark the impact of essential omega-3 fatty acids in health
        and disease, as well as provide new therapeutic approaches.</p></sec></sec><sec
